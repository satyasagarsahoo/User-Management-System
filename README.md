**Project Description: Spring Boot User Management System**
This project is a User Management System (UMS) built using the Spring Boot framework (Java) for the robust back-end, and integrated with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end user interface. It utilizes MySQL as the relational database.
The system's core function is to facilitate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user accounts. It includes secure features for user authentication (Login/Registration) and authorization via role-based access control, allowing administrators full control over the user base. Spring Boot manages the application logic, handles security, and connects efficiently to the MySQL database for data persistence.

**Steps to Run the Spring Boot Project**
1) Download and Extract: Download the project source code  and extract its contents to your desired directory.
2) Open in VS Code: Launch Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and open the extracted project folder.
3) Prepare MySQL Database:Open your local MySQL environment .
4) Create a new database .
5) Configure Database Connection:Locate and open the configuration file, typically named application.properties to match the name you created in the previous step.
6) Ensure the username and password in this file match your local MySQL credentials.Run the Application:Open the integrated Terminal within VS Code.
7) Navigate to the root directory of the project (where the pom.xml file is located).
8) Execute the following command to compile the project and start the Spring Boot server:mvn spring-boot:run
9) Access: Once the console output confirms the application has started.
10) Open your web browser and navigate to the local address (typically http://localhost:8080).
